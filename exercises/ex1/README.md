# Smallest enclosing circle

Implement the algorithms to find the enclosing circle of a set of points:
1. Heuristic algorithm
2. Smallest enclosing circle algorithm

It is asked:

- For a given set of points *"points.txt"*, what are the obtained circles (center and radius)?
- Test your algorithms with differents number of points *n*, randomly generated. How does algorithms' execution time vary with *n*?
